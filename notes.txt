Possible discovered bugs:
- evaluate likelihood
    - there was a missing softmax 
- optimization of priors 
    - should be negative loss that we minimize 
    - better to optimize logarithm
    - see how it's done in VaLLA 
- extra softmax in Kronecker that should not be there 


Done Changes 
- Lora rank decreased to 1
    - To reduce the overfitting
- Early stopping




Possible Improvements
- Ensemmble of LoRAa
    - this would be the easiest way
